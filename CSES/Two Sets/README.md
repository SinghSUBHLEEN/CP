To divide the set into two equal halves, we need to need to add corresponding elements.

        For n=8,

            1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8

        We can get same sum of pairs by combining the pairs

            (1, 8), (2, 7), (3, 6), (4 ,5)

        But, here the total number of pairs formed is equal to 4 which even. So, we can divide these even pairs into two equal halves to get the same sum on both side or else the sum wouldn't have been the same.

        We can not do the same for 6 because it gives 3 pairs and so same sum can not be achieved.

        Observation:

            for n = even, (n/2) should also be even

        For n=9,
        
            1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9
        
        We can get same sum of pairs by combining the pairs

            (1, 8), (2, 7), (3, 6), (4 ,5)  9

        Now, we have a total of 5 groups to be divided into two equal halves. So, this means that we can not divide it into two sets.

        Observation:

            for n = odd, (n-1)/2 should also be odd.
        
    


    (1, 6)  (2, 5)  (3, 4) 7  pairs1 = (n-1)/4-1
